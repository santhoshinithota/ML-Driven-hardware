# ML-Driven-hardware
The project is to develop a simple circuit (hardware) that can adapt by itself to the changes in voltage, temperature, etc.in order to negate all or part of their effects on the circuit performance characteristics. To do so, the circuit will be represented by a machine learning technique implemented on Arduino board.
